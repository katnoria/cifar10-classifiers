# Build CIFAR 10 Classifiers

A collection on notebooks that cover building image classfiers using various deep learning frameworks as part of [this post](https://www.katnoria.com/cifar10-notebooks/).

The objectives are to show how to:

- create a simple classifier using CNNs
- track experiments using Comet.ml, WandB
- use hyperparameter tuning frameworks such as Keras-Tuner, Optuna, Ray Tune


# Frameworks

- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Lightning
