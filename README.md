# Build CIFAR 10 Classifiers

A collection on notebooks that cover building image classfiers using various deep learning frameworks as part of [this post](https://www.katnoria.com/cifar10-notebooks/).

The objectives are to show how to:

- create a simple classifier using CNNs
- track experiments
- use hyperparameter tuning frameworks


# Frameworks

- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Lightning
